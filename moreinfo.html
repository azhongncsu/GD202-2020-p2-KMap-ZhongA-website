<h3>MEETINGS</h3>
<p>Talley is a space for meetings, both formal and informal.

Informal meetings such as meeting up for social activities and eating also occur here.   </p>

<h3>EVENTS</h3>
<p>A variety of events are held at Talley, such as career fairs, performances, talks and much more. On the second floor, there are also organizations at the tables having fundraisers or trying to attract students for certain purposes.
